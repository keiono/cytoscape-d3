## Release history
* 9/28/2014 - Version 1.0.2 released.  Minor fixes only (no new features).
* 9/15/2014 - Version 1.0.1 released.  Node locations (x, y) will be added as node property when user select Network and View.
 

## What is this for?
This is a [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) app for exporting network and data table to [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) style JSON.  D3.js is a JavaScript library for data visualization, and some of its preset layouts support network/tree data structure.  This app directly creates JSON file for those presets from Cytoscape network and data tables.

Currently, this App supports:

* Network JSON for force layout ([example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045))
* Tree JSON ([example](http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111018/tree.html))
